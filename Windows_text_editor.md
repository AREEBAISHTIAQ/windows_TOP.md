# Windows
## What comes with Windows
### Notepad
**Notepad** comes built into windows,and is readily available on your machine and it's good for **text-only** (plain-text, `.txt` ) files . When writing software, it lacks many of the features a developer would want in a code editor. Notepad lacks syntax highlighting (which helps you read code), auto closing of brackets (so you don't forget to close a {), auto indentation (so you don't have to push the space bar a lot),Notepad supports both left-to-right and right-to-left based languages and many other things, if you want to know more about **Notepad** Click [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Notepad#Features).

## Suggestions
### Visual Studio Code (VSCode)
**Visual Studio Code** is source code editor created by **Microsoft**. A few of the great things about VSCode are, it supports many programming languages, it has many useful **Extentions** and more are being built everyday, it is cross-platform and totally free and you can do a very lite and sweet setup to automate and do most of your work from within VSCode. But the best thing about VSCode is that, it provides just enough of the automation without taking over like the conventional IDE's, so even though you can make your workflow significantly faster with VSCode - You'd still have control over everything that is happening.

### Sublime Text
**Sublime Text** is a proprietary cross-platform source code editor,A few of the great things about Sublime text are, it support many programming languages and markup languages,**Sublime Text** has a powerful, Python API that allows plugins to augment built-in functionality,it has **Command Palette** that holds infrequently used functionality, like sorting, changing the syntax and changing the indentation settings, it is extrenemely light-weight and flexible, if you want to know more about **Sublime text** you can easily read it from [here](https://www.sublimetext.com/) it costs money but if you want to try it, you can download free trial of **Sublime text 3** it's a trial but it's unlimited so you can use it for free.

### Atom
**Atom** is a open source text and source code editor, it is created by Github, A few great things about Atom are,it is considered to be easiest Test Editor to use, it has **Teletype** so you can share your code with others, if you already have Atom you can install **Teletype** and other atom-pakages from [here](https://atom.io/packages), it has context-aware auto-completion, code navigation features such as an outline view, go to definition and find all references. You can also hover-to-reveal information, diagnostics (errors and warnings) and document formatting, it has decent plugin support,you can work with Git and GitHub directly from Atom with the GitHub package and it's totally free to use.

## TLDR
+ **Atom** is considered to be easiest to use.
+ **Sublime** Text is lightest and fastest performing due to being a natively written application.
+ **Visual Studio Code** is a nice balance between Atom and Sublime Text. It's generally faster and more flexible than atom and easier to use than sublime text.

## Conclusion
We recommend you to install **Visual Studio Code** because of its compatibility, speed, great support but if you want to install [**Sublime**](https://www.sublimetext.com/3) or [**Atom**](https://www.techspot.com/downloads/6540-atom-text-editor.htm) you can easily install them.
