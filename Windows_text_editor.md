## What comes with Windows
### Notepad
**Notepad** comes built into windows,and is readily available on your machine and it's good for **text-only** (plain-text, `.txt` ) files . When writing software, it lacks many of the features a developer would want in a code editor. Notepad lacks syntax highlighting (which helps you read code), auto closing of brackets (so you don't forget to close a {), auto indentation (so you don't have to push the space bar a lot),Notepad supports both left-to-right and right-to-left based languages and many other things, if you want to know more about **Notepad** Click [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Notepad#Features).

But the best thing about VSCode is that, it provides just enough of the automation without taking over like the conventional IDE's, so even though you can make your workflow significantly faster with VSCode - You'd still have control over everything that is happening.
